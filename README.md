# Unidentified-Vehicle-Tracking
Objective of this project is to develop a Computer Vision algorithm in MATLAB to track a single
unrecognized vehicle in a video stream using its features even in the presence of other similar
targets and occlusions, and detect suspicious activity (if any) over a IP Camera Network in real
time. 

This project/ research work is a part of an M.tech. Thesis project of ECE department, Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture & Technology. The development code cannot be revealed as the research work is under review for possible publication in a scientific journal. The output images elaborate the results obtained.
